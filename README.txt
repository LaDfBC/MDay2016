Hi Mom!  Happy Mother's....Year?
Anyway, I love you and thought this would be a cool thing to do for you.
The idea is for you to have a way to request that I wrote some automated stuff that would help you do...whatever
As an example, the first option will send me an email - you'd rather prefer just logging in to your email, but it's an example
The second is an example of how a friendly Secret Santa exchange could be set up.  You could just hit some buttons and it'd work!

I'll be adding all of the stuff shortly - it'll be my pet project over the next few weeks, so if you draw this note first, just hang tight
and come up with ideas!
